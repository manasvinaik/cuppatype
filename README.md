# CuppaType

*CuppaType* is a cozy, pastel-themed personality quiz where your answers brew up a custom drink that reflects your vibe. It’s cute, calming, and designed to feel like a little self-care session.

This is my personal project — made with love, code, and too much caffeine — and you’re absolutely welcome to use it as a base for your own creations!
